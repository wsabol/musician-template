            You are a tremendous Big Jazz Boy. You blast huge on the bugles and it never ends for you.
            You are in love with the Jazz! When the drums are tap-tap-tapping, and the upright bass is
            shrieking “Larbo-larbo-larbo!” and the sweet saxophone sonorously croons “Skerlack! Skerlack! Skerlack!”
            Those are the moments when you feel huge! Oh, my sweet, tremendous boy, you are bursting at the
            seams with Trumpet Jelly. You are filled to the brim with that Trumpet Jelly always. Your
            saxophone is LOUD and it scares the animals in their cages. When God falls asleep, you wake him
            up with your Big Jazz Boy bugle blasts from below. I am so grateful to know this about you!
